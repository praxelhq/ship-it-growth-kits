# Luna — Measurement

## Day 0: write the baseline before changing the page

**Target: 1,000 signups in 30 days**, under the [consumer target policy](../../TARGET-POLICY.md). For this product, count **a new person creating their own account for cycle tracking; a sample-demo visit does not count**. Exclude your own tests, bots and repeat identities. Do not count simulated baskets, repeated demo sessions or each logged day as new people.

**Activation:** the person saves a real cycle or symptom entry and can find their own history; count only completion metadata, never the entry text. Report the signup and activation totals beside one another every week. A view, a CTA click or a download attempt is not automatically either.

| Baseline | Where you get it | State to record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing eligible signups / first starts | Your account or product event store | Not established by public-page research; record the actual value today. |
| Activated people to date and last 7 days | The specific completion event below | Record actual value, or say instrumentation not yet available. |
| Site sessions and top sources | Your existing analytics | Record the period and exclude your test session. |
| Conversion and largest drop-off | Start → completion events | Establish with five observed tests, not a guessed benchmark. |
| Public cohort reading / position | [Your project profile](https://shipped.money/p/luna) | Record current value, timestamp and period. Missing reading is unknown, not zero. |

[Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) can help on public landing pages if configured consistently with your privacy promise and consent choices. Check whether it is already present before installing a second tag. Do not put health entries, dates or notes into Clarity, replay or marketing analytics. Use aggregate completion counts consistent with consent and the actual privacy policy; disable replay on sensitive routes.

## Product events, with a reason

- `account_created`: one eligible non-test person.
- `first_entry_saved`: activation metadata only.
- `history_opened`: whether the saved record can be found.
- `export_or_delete_control_used`: aggregate only where disclosed.
- `later_logging_day`: voluntary return, not another signup.

Keep the source on the first visit and the date of the first eligible completion. Show counts by source and the observed conversion fraction. Record returning people separately; do not add overlapping 24-hour cohort readings to manufacture a monthly total. The leaderboard is context, not your definition of a successful user.

## Weekly review

| Checkpoint | What you write down | What you change if behind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 7 | The five private invitations, one maker post and one clip scheduled through Day 7: record actual deliveries, visits, first starts and completions; watch five attempts. | If nobody qualified starts, change the invitation. If people start but fail, fix `04` before more distribution. |
| Day 14 | Cumulative signups + activations, best source and repeat-use cohort. | Compare actual rates with `02`; stop the weaker route after two real attempts, not after one unanswered message. |
| Day 21 | Repeat use, partner attendance and hours spent per activated person. | Repeat the channel that produced finished use. Drop publicity that creates support but no useful completions. |
| Day 28 | New versus returning people, activation rate, complaints or failed expectations. | Close the largest gap you can demonstrate. Do not loosen the counting rule. |
| Day 30 | Verified signups, activated people, returners, revenue if real, hours and unresolved problems. | Explain the shortfall from 1,000 and the observed next-month route. |

These are decision checkpoints, not invented weekly growth promises. If people mistake the basket for delivery or the range for medical certainty, clarify before acquiring more users. If accounts are created but no entry is saved, investigate trust and input friction rather than adding a louder health claim.

## Your one-page results note

Write the actual dates; eligible signups; activated people; people who returned; the source that produced them; the largest point of abandonment; one real change and what happened afterwards. Separate paid transactions from free use, and revenue from profit. Quote users only with permission. If you are below target but have a small cohort returning for the intended job, show that evidence plainly.
